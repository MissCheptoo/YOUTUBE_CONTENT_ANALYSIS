PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to analyze YouTube channel data to understand the relationship between a channel's creation date, subscriber count, total videos, and total views. By examining these metrics, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to channel growth and engagement. 
Generate your own Youtube API key. 

DATASET

The dataset includes the following columns:
1. channel_name: The name of each YouTube channel.
2. date_created: The date each channel was created.
3. subscribers: The number of subscribers each channel has.
4. total_videos: The total number of videos each channel has uploaded.
5. total_views: The total views each channel has accumulated.

The data is the visualized.

CONCLUSION

To maximize growth and engagement, channels should focus on building a strong subscriber base while maintaining consistent content quality. While frequent uploads may help increase total views, gaining subscribers requires more than just quantity. Channels with established, engaged audiences tend to have higher viewership, emphasizing the value of cultivating loyal followers. This insight can guide future strategies for content creation and audience development on YouTube.
